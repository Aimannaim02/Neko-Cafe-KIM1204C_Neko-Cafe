      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 2009</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">To get the opportunities to stand along with any other great and successful café, we decided to add some spice that some of the café might not have. The uniqueness of our café made us stand out even more rather than any other normal café as we chose to apply two combination of people's favourite which are café and cats. It is a brand new way for you to enjoy your desserts while playing with cats. Most of the people out there might think that this is such an unhygienic way to enjoy your meal as there might have some furs in it but do not worry as we do separate the space between cats and the customers. Not to mention about the foods and beverages that we serve here, many of our classic meals have French influences and have mouthwateringly distinct, sweet, and rich flavours. We have a devoted following that keeps coming back for more thanks to our laid-back ambiance, mouthwatering food, friendly staff, and attentive service. With our special services, we promising our customer all the best and happiness always.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Neko Café’s mission is to become a place to visit and a new trend for cat lovers, as well as the first and most popular spot for them to enjoy their coffee time while speaking or playing with the cats.</h5>
      <br>
      <h2 class="w3-center"><u><b>Our Objectives</b></u></h2>
      <h5 class="w3-center"><h1 class="w3-center"></h1>
      <h5 class="w3-center">As our café serves are based on cats and desserts, our targeted customers are mostly cat lovers and dessert lovers. By this, we actually can fulfill the two needs and combine the element of two of our customer’s passions which they can enjoy being cat lovers by playing with cats and enjoy being dessert lovers at once and enjoying their coffee time. Besides, our other objectives and purposes are to make shelters for stray cats. As we all know stray cats are abandoned and most likely to be ignored by people because of their look, their hygienic and many more. This makes them feel less-loved as people nowadays tend to choose cats that are fluffy, neat and tidy, playful and prefer healthy cats. To affirm this situation, stray cats aren’t actually that bad, all they need is just a healthy, tidy and suitable shelter for them to be just like other cats. So, we make this cafe to preserve and protect stray cats from being abandoned and make them feel loved.</h5>
